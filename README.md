# nested-checkbox
Requirements:

Write code in React (and HTML and CSS if needed) to render a checkbox that can be nested with any number of levels based on the given JavaScript object. 
There are 3 extra requirements that make the problem a bit more challenging to solve:
1. If a checkbox is checked / unchecked, all of its descendants should become checked / unchecked.

2. If all descendants of a checkbox are checked, that checkbox should be checked

3. If any of the descendants of a checkbox is unchecked, that checkbox should also be unchecked

Solution:
Make use of HTML, JS concept with Tree concept.
